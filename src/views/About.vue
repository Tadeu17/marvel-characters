        This is a simple project to practice the front end connection to an api,
        to practice the basic routing skills and vuex store best practices with
        high focus on the latter.
      </li>

      <li>
        Also a way to practice testing in the vuex store, getting more familiar
        with general testing
      </li>

      <li>
        Some of the main topics that were address was keeping things cached in
        some way, and styling wise allowing responsiveness in a simple way
      </li>

      <li>
        Testing is a not so good developed skill so the time and project was
        also used to deepen the knowledge on the topic and practice it at the
        same time
      </li>

      <li>
        There are several improvements that can be made especially on code
        structure, but for a base project, this version so far feels like pretty
        enough.
      </li>

      <li>
        Some of those improvements would be for example the creation of a api
        service properly configured, adding specific generic styling and
        actually conceptualizing a more interesting UI/UX experience (this
        wasn't the focus at all in this project)
